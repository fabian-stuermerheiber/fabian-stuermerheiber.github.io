We estimate a dynamic discrete choice model of female labour supply and childcare decision on German panel data. We  account for a large amount of heterogeneity: beyond heterogeneous preferences, education levels, wages, and availability of informal child care, we also account for heterogeneity in fertility such as timing of birth(s) and number of children. This allows us to analyse various (counterfactual) policy experiments and account for the heterogeneous responses to such policies. First, we evaluate a nationwide public childcare expansion in Germany and find that the increase in publicly provided childcare supply fully paid for itself through the dynamic effects on maternal earnings and tax payments. Increasing subsidies further from the current generous levels (~ 80%), however, would only be  6% self-financing because it would primarily benefit households that are infra-marginal in their childcare and labour supply decision.","tags":null,"title":"The Fiscal Return to Childcare Policies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabian Stürmer-Heiber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619913600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619913600,"objectID":"32d99ec02efe6d2d674e9ee27569ada6","permalink":"https://fabian.stuermerheiber.github.io/publication/promotions/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/promotions/","section":"publication","summary":"Early career years for both men and women are characterized by a fast accumulation of human capital. However, despite starting with comparable qualifications, young men are promoted at higher rates than young women. One potential underlying reason is that employers take the cost of (long) maternity leave into account when making promotion decisions. In this paper, we first present novel descriptive evidence on the gender gap in promotion rates using high-quality administrative data from Germany. Second, we exploit quasi-random variation induced by a staggered expansion of public childcare to identify the causal effect of childcare availability on women’s pre-birth promotion probabilities. We find that a ten percentage point increase in childcare availability increases the promotion probability of young women by approximately ten percent. As public childcare allows mothers to return to labor market earlier, this result provides evidence for the hypothesis that the expansion effectively reduced the leave-related cost for employers, thereby boosting young women’s career prospects.","tags":null,"title":"Women’s early careers and childcare policy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ulrich Schneider","Fabian Stürmer-Heiber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619827200,"objectID":"56c0c22f693b2e012dd8da39aec452a0","permalink":"https://fabian.stuermerheiber.github.io/publication/hours/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hours/","section":"publication","summary":"We disentangle the effects of working different part-time hours on current and expected future wages using administrative employee records.","tags":null,"title":"The Career Cost of Working Part-Time","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://fabian.stuermerheiber.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
